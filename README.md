## Inspiration
Move-detection sensors are developing very rapidly. There are a lot of apps in this area, but mostly for fitness. Now here's the application for musicians, which help them improve their sense of rhythm.

## What it does
This application tracks the movement of your hand via Movesense sensors and gives you the information about how you fit into the musical Rhythm. Which differs this app from other music learning applications is that you don't need any guitar signal. Even more, you can use this app for tracking your drum playing, for example.

## How we built it
This is a common android application made with Kotlin and Java languages. Program is split onto 3 parts: interacting with sensors, processing the signal and displaying the plot in realtime.

## Challenges we ran into
Initially, it was hard to make the right tracking of the hand movements.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We've made the MVP prototype, which tracks movements of your hand and displays the visual feedback of how rhythmical it is.

## What we learned
We were pretty new to the signal processing, but we believe, that we handled it.

## What's next for Rhythmify
For now, application allows you to train your rhythms in solo mode. We want to make multiple musicians from the same band to interconnect with each other and train their rhythmic consistency as a band. Also, some gamification is possible in the future.
